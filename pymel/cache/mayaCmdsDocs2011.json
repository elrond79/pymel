To add a non-double attribute the following criteria can be used to determine whether the dataType or the attributeType flag is appropriate. Some types, such as double3can use either. In these cases the -dtflag should be used when you only wish to access the data as an atomic entity (eg. you never want to access the three individual values that make up a double3). In general it is best to use the -atin these cases for maximum flexibility. In most cases the -dtversion will not display in the attribute editor as it is an atomic type and you are not allowed to change individual parts of it.

If no attribute is named, addPP returns a warning and does nothing. The command adds any other necessary attributes wherever they are needed, and makes all necessary connections. If any of the attributes already exist, the command simply connects to them. The command also toggles any relevant attributes in the emitter or field to indicate that per-point capability is being used. The command adds a separate per-point attribute to the owning object for each emitter/field. For example, for emission rate, there is a separate ratePP for each emitter. These attributes are named according to the convention emitter/field nameattr namePP. For example, if a particle shape owned an emitter \"smoke\", that shape would get attribute \"smokeRatePP.\" The name of the object must be the emitter or field for which per-point capability is to be added (or the name of its parent transform). The addPP command adds the per-point capability for that emitter or field but not for any others owned by the same object. If per-point capability is not supported for a named object, the command will issue a warning, but will continue executing for any other objects which were valid. If no objects are named, addPP uses any objects in the current selection list for which the specified attribute is applicable. (For example, it would add per-point rate for all selected emitters.) If addPP detects that the owner object has left-over attributes from a deleted emitter, it will remove those attributes before adding the new ones. Thus, you can delete the emitter, make a new one, and run addPP again, and addPP will clean up after the deleted emitter. This is most commonly used if you have a geometry emitter and then decide to change the geometry. Likewise, if addPP detects that some cvs or vertices have been added to the geometry, then it will expand the corresponding multi-attributes as necessary. However, if it detects that some cvs/vertices have been removed, it will not remove any entries from the multi. See the user manual for more discussion. ",

By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, float field and float slider (for values with a min or max specified) The group also supports the notion of a larger secondary range of possible field values. If an attribute is specified for this object, then it will use any min and max values defined in the attribute. The user-specified values can reduce the min and max, but cannot expand them. The field created here is an expression field -- while normally operating as a float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the character \"-\". This will expand the field to occupy the space previously taken by the slider. The field also has an automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button.

By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged label navigation button. The group is used to help the user manage connections to a particular attribute. When creating the control you have the opportunity to attach scripts to the control that are executed on various UI events. You can define what happens when the navigation button is pressed, and when a node is dragged and dropped onto this attribute. The navigation button can traverse to the connected node or can bring up UI to create new connections to the attribute. The button also can show you state information: if there already exists a connection/if the connection is ignored. ",

A typical usage would be on a shape that has both modelling operations and deformers in its history. Using this command with the -prePostDeformers flag will bake the modeling portions of the graph, so that only the deformers remain. Note that not all modeling operations can be baked such that they create exactly the same effect after baking. For example, imagine the history contains a skinning operation followed by a smooth. Before baking, the smooth operation is performed each time the skin deforms, so it will smooth differently depending on the output of the skin. When the smooth operation is baked into the skinning, the skin will be reweighted based on the smooth points to attempt to approximate the original behavior. However, the skin node does not perform the smooth operation, it merely performs skinning with the newly calculated weights and the result will not be identical to before the bake. In general, modeling operations that occur before deformers can be baked precisely. Those which occur after can only be approximated. The -pre and -post flags allow you to control whether only the operations before or after the deformers are baked. When the command is used on an object with no deformers, the entire history will be deleted. ",

Multiple shapes and multiple skeletons can be bound at once by selecting them or specifying them on the command line. Selection order is not important.The skin is bound using the so-called \"rigid\" bind, in which the components are rigidly attached to the closest bone in the skeleton. Flexors can later be added to the skeleton to smooth out the skinning around joints.The skin(s) can be bound either to the entire skeleton hierarchy of the selected joint(s), or to only the selected joints. The entire hierarchy is the default. The -tsb/-toSelectedBones flag allows binding to only the selected bones.This command can also be used to detach the skin from the skeleton. Detaching the skin is useful in a variety of situations, such as: inserting additional bones, deleting bones, changing the bind position of the skeleton or skin, or simply getting rid of the skinning nodes altogether. The options to use when detaching the skin depend on how much of the skinning info you want to get rid of. Namely: (1) -delete or -unbind: remove all skinning nodes, (2) -unbindKeepHistory: remove the skinning sets, but keep the weights, (3) -disable: disable the skinning but keep the skinning sets and the weights.

Now that the pixel has a size, resolution gives us a complete image. That image will match the film back exactly in width. It will almost never match in height, either being too tall or too short. By playing with the numbers you can get it pretty close though.verticalThis is the same idea as horizontal fit, only applied vertically. Thus the digital image will match the film back exactly in height, but miss in width.fillThis is a convenience item.

Instead of drawing all objects with a single camera, you can isolate the camera to only focus on certain objects and layer another camera into the viewport that draws the other objects. The situation to use camera sets primarily occurs when building stereoscopic scenes. For example, a set of stereo parameters may make the background objects divergent beyond the tolerable range of the human perceptual system. However, you like the settings because the main focus is in the foreground and the depth is important to the visual look of the scene. You can use camera sets to break apart the shot into a foreground stereo camera and background stereo camera. The foreground stereo camera will retain the original parameters; however, it will only focus on the foreground elements. The background stereo camera will have a different set of stereo parameters and will only draw the background element. Camera sets can be viewed using the stereo viewer and are currently only designed to work with stereo camera rigs. ",

Or, a revolve surface could change its input curve depending on some transform's rotation value.The choice command creates a choice node (if one does not already exist) on all specified attributes of the selected objects. If the attribute was already connected to something, that something is now reconnected to the i'th index of the choice node's input (or the next available input if the -in/index flag is not specified). If a source attribute is specified, then that attribute is connected to the choice node's i'th input instead.The choice node operates by using the value of its selector attribute to determine which of its input attributes to pass through to its output. The input attributes can be of any type. For example, if the selector attribute was connected by an animation curve with keyframes at (1,1), (30,2) and (50,1), then that would mean that the choice node would pass on the data from input[1] from time 1 to 30, and after time 50, and the data from input[2] between times 30 and 50.This command returns the names of the created or modified choice nodes, and if a keyframe was added to the animation curve, it specifies the index (or value on the animation curve).

These values are stored in the geoConnector node for the geometry object. Unlike earlier versions of Maya, there is no separate \"collision node.\" If a soft object is in the selection list, the collision command assumes that you want to make it a collider. In order to make the soft object collide with something use, use connectDynamic -c. The collision menu option sorts this out using the lead object rule and issues the necessary commands. On creation, this command returns a string arrayof the geometry names that were setup for particle collision.When the command is used to query information, there are several possible return types. These include: If the -resilience or -friction flag is passed on the command line and a single collision geometry is either selected or on the command line, then resilience or friction value for that collision geometry is returned as a single floatvalue.If the -resilience or -friction flag is passed on the command line and a single collision geometry and a single particle object are either selected or on the command line, then two results might occur. If the particle object is not set up to collide with the geometry, then an error is displayed stating that. If the objects are set up to collide with each other, then the resilience or friction value that the particle object is using for collisions with the geometry is returned as a single floatvalue. This can be different than the geometry's resilience and friction, because the user may break the connection from the geometry's geoConnector node's resilience or friction to the particle, and set a different value in the particle's collisionResilience, collisionFriction or collisionOffset attribute that is used for that geometry. This allows the user to make each particle respond to the same surface differently.If neither flag is pass on the command line and a single geometry and single particle object are either selected or on the command line, then a single integervalue of 1 is returned if the objects are set up to collide with each other, and 0 is returned if they are not.Lastly, if no flags are passed on the command line and a single particle object is either selected or on the command line, then a string arraywith the names of all geometries that the particle object will collide against and the multiIndex that the geometries are connected to is returned.

The same is true for emitters and collisions. Different connection types (i.e., for fields vs. emitters) between the same pair of objects are logically independent. In other words, an object can be influenced by another object's fields without being influenced by its emitters or collisions. Each connected object must be a dynamic object. The object connected to can be any object that owns fields, emitters, etc.; it need not be dynamic. Objects that can own influences are particles, geometry objects (nurbs and polys) and lattices.

Similarly, if the current time unit is Film (24 frames per second), then the command: currentTime 6; will be interpreted as setting the current time to frame 6 in the Film unit, which is 6/24 or 0.25 seconds. You can always override the unit of a particular numeric value to a command be specifying it one the command. For example, using the above examples: move 5m -2mm 3cm; sphere -radius 4inch; currentTime 6ntsc; would move the object 5 meters in X, -2 millimeters in Y, 3 centimeters in Z, create a sphere of radius 4 inches, and change the current time to 6 frames in the NTSC unit, which would be 0.2 seconds, or 4.8 frames in the current (Film) unit.

Normally the return value is a boolean indicating whether or not the given items were involved in a cycle. If the -list flag is used then the return value is the list of all plugs in cycles (involving the selected plug or node if any). Note that it is possible for evaluation cycles to occur even where no DG connections exist. Here are some examples: 1) Nodes with evaluation-time dependent connections: An example is expression nodes, because we cannot tell what an expression node is actually referring to until it is evaluated, and such evaluation-time dependent nodes may behave differently based on the context (e.g. time) they are evaluated at. If you suspect a cycle due to such a connection, the best way to detect the cycle is through manual inspection. 2) Cycles due to DAG hierarchy: noting that DAG nodes are implicitely connected through parenting, if a child DAG node connects an output into the input of a parent node, a cycle will exist if the plugs involved also affect each other. In order to enable detection of cycles involving the DAG, add the -dag flag to the command line. Note also that this command may incorrectly report a cycle on an instanced skeleton where some of the instances use IK. You will have to examine the reported cycle yourself to determine if it is truly a cycle or not. The evaluation time cycle checking will not report false cycles. ",

        "description": "This command measures dependency graph node performance by managing timers on a per-node basis. Logically, each DG node has a timer associated with it which records the amount of real time spent in various operations on its plugs. The time measurement includes the cost of copying data to the node on behalf of the operation, MEL commands executed by an expression contained in an expression invoked by the node, and includes any wait time such as when a fileTexture node loads an image file from disk. Most DG operations are reported including compute, draw, and dirty propagation. The various operations we measure are called \"metrics\" and the types of timers are called \"timer types\". The various metrics are always measured when timing is on, but are only queried when specified via the -show and -hide flags. The metrics currently supported are listed in detail under the -show flag below. For each metric we support a standard set of timer types. There are three of these: \"self\" for self time (the time specific to the node and not its children), \"inclusive\" (time including children of the node), and \"count\" (number of operations of the given metric on the node). The timing mechanism which is used by dgtimeris built into the DG itself, thus ALL depend nodes can be timed and there is no need for programmers writing plug-ins using the OpenMaya API to add any special code in order for their nodes to be timed -- its all handled transparently. The dgtimercommand allows node timers to be turned on, off, reset to zero, and have their current value displayed, and these operations can be performed globally on all nodes or on a specific set of nodes defined by name, type or parentage. Note that all timer measurements are computed in \"real time\" (the same time measurement you get from a wristwatch) as opposed to \"CPU time\" (which only measures time when the processor is executing your code). All times are displayed in seconds. Use the -query flag to display the current timer values on a node,use -on to turn on timing,use -off to turn off timing,and -reset to reset timers to zero. To display the values measured during timing, there are two approaches. The first method is to use the -query flag can be used to report the information which has been measured. The second method is to use the query methods available on the OpenMaya class MFnDependencyNode (see the OpenMaya documentation for details). What follows is a description of what is generated via -query. The output is broken out into several sections and these are described as follows: SECTION 1:Section 1 of the dgtimer output contains global information. This section can be disabled via the -hoHeader flag. These values are reset whenever a global timer reset occurs (i.e. dgtimer -reset;is specified). The global values which are reported are: Total real time:the total wall-clock time since the last global timer reset. This is the actual time which has been spent as you might measure it measure it with your watch. On a multi-processing system, this value will always remain true to to real time (unlike userand systime).Total user time:the total time the CPU(s) spent processing Maya not including any system time since the last global timer reset.Total sys time:the total time the CPU(s) spent in operating system calls on behalf of Maya since the last global timer reset.Summary of each metric for all nodes:a summary of self and count for each metric that we measure:Real time in callbacksreports the self time and count for the \"callback\" metric.Real time in computereports the self time and count for the \"compute\" metric.Real time in dirty propagationreports the self time and count for the \"dirty\" metric.Real time in drawingreports the self time and count for the \"draw\" metric.Real time fetching data from plugsreports the self time and count for the \"fetch\" metric.Breakdown of select metrics in greater detail:a reporting of certain combinations of metrics that we measure:Real time in compute invoked from callbackreports the self time spent in compute when invoked either directly or indirectly by a callback.Real time in compute not invoked from callbackreports the self time spent in compute not invoked either directly or indirectly by a callback.SECTION 2:Section 2 of the dgtimer -query output contains per-node information. There is a header which describes the meaning of each column, followed by the actual per-node data, and this is ultimately followed by a footer which summarises the totals per column. Note that the data contained in the footer is the global total for each metric and will include any nodes that have been deleted since the last reset, so the value in the footer MAY exceed what you get when you total the individual values in the column. To prevent the header and footer from appearing, use the -noHeader flag to just display the per-node data. The columns which are displayed are as follows: Rank:The order of this node in the sorted list of all nodes, where the list is sorted by -sortMetric and -sortType flag values (if these are omitted the default is to sort by self compute time).ON:Tells you if the timer for that node is currently on or off. (With dgtimer, you have the ability to turn timing on and off on a per-node basis).Per-metric information:various columns are reported for each metric. The name of the metric is reported at in the header in capital letters (e.g. \"DRAW\"). The standard columns for each metric are:Self:The amount of real time (i.e. elapsed time as you might measure it with a stopwatch) spent performing the operation (thus if the metric is \"DRAW\", then this will be time spent drawing the node).Inclusive:The amount of real time (i.e. elapsed time as you might measure it with a stopwatch) spent performing the operation including any child operations that were invoked on behalf of the operation (thus if the metric is \"DRAW\", then this will be the total time taken to draw the node including any child operations).Count:The number of operations that occued on this node (thus if the metric is \"DRAW\", then the number of draw operations on the node will be reported).Sort informationif a column is the one being used to sort all the per-node dgtimer information, then that column is followed by a Percentand Cumulativecolumn which describe a running total through the listing. Note that \"-sortType none\" prevents these two columns from appearing and implicitely sorts on \"self\" time.After the per-metric columns, the node name and type are reported:TypeThe node type.NameThe name of the node. If the node is file referenced and you are using namespaces, the namespace will be included. You can also force the dagpath to be displayed by specifying the -uniqueName flag.Plug-in nameIf the node was implemented in an OpenMaya plug-in, the name of that plug-in is reported.SECTION 3:Section 3 of the dgtimer -query output describes time spent in callbacks. Note that section 3 only appears when the CALLBACK metric is shown (see the -show flag). The first part is SECTION 3.1 lists the time per callback with each entry comprising: The name of the callback, such as \"attributeChangedMsg\". These names are internal Maya names, and in the cases where the callback is available through the OpenMaya API, the API access to the callback is similarly named.The name is followed by a breakdown per callbackId. The callbackId is an identifying number which is unique to each client that is registered to a callback and can be deduced by the user, such as through the OpenMaya API. You can cross-reference by finding the same callbackId value listed in SECTIONs 3.1 and 3.3.Self time (i.e. real time spent within that callbackId type not including any child operations which occur while processing the callback).Percent (see the -sortType flag). Note that the percent values are listed to sum up to 100% for that callback. This is not a global percent.Cumulative (see the -sortType flag).Inclusive time (i.e. real time spent within that callbackId including any child operations).Count (number of times the callbackId was invoked).API lists \"Y\" if the callbackId was defined through the OpenMaya API, and \"N\" if the callbackId was defined internally within Maya.Node lists the name of the node this callbackId was associated with. If the callbackId was associated with more than one node, the string \"\\*multiple\\*\" is printed. If there was no node associated with the callbackId (or its a callback type in which the node is hard to deduce), the entry is blank.After the callbackId entries are listed, a dashed line is printed followed by a single line listing the self, inclusive and count values for the callback. Note that the percent is relative to the global callback time.At the bottom of SECTION 3.1 is the per-column total. The values printed match the summation at the bottom of the listing in section 2. Note that the values from SECTION 3.1 include any nodes that have been deleted since the last reset. The thresholding parameters (-threshold, -rangeLower, -rangeUpper and -maxDisplay) are honoured when generating the listing. The sorting of the rows and display of the Percent and Cumulative columns obeys the -sortType flag. As the listing can be long, zero entries are not displayed. The second part is SECTION 3.2 which lists the data per callbackId. As noted earlier, the callbackId is an identifying number which is unique to each client that is registered to a callback and can be deduced by the user, such as through the OpenMaya API. The entries in SECTION 3.2 appear as follows: CallbackId the numeric identifier for the callback. You can cross reference by finding the same callbackId value listed in SECTIONs 3.1 and 3.3.For each callbackId, the data is broken down per-callback:Callback the name of the callback, e.g. \"attributeChangedMsg\".Percent, Cumulative, Inclusive, Count, API and Node entries as described in SECTION 3.1.After the callback entries are listed for the callbackId, a dashed followed by a summary line is printed. The summary line lists the self, inclusive and count values for the callback. Note that the percent is relative to the global callback time.The third part is SECTION 3.3 which lists data per-callback per-node. The nodes are sorted based on the -sortType flag, and for each node, the callbacks are listed, also sorted based on the -sortType flag. As this listing can be long, zero entries are not displayed. An important note for SECTION 3.3 is that only nodes which still exist are displayed. If a node has been deleted, no infromation is listed. ",

It sets the useParticleRenderCache attribute to true, and the min/maxFrameOfLastParticleRenderCache attributes to correspond to the min and max frames. Exported .pda or .pdb files are assigned a name of form object name.frame.extension, where extensionis \"pda\" or \"pdb.\" The naming convention for .pdc files is similar but does not use frame numbers, it uses a more precise representation of the time instead. By default, the pda and pdb formats export all per-particle attributes, and all integer or float type attributes except those which are hidden or not storable. (Exception: level of detail is not exported, by default) The pdc format exports all attributes which the particle object needs for its state cache. To specify only selected attributes, use the -atr flag (which is multi-use). In general, it is recommended not to use this flag with pdc type, since you need all the attributes in order for the cache to be useful. dynExport exports data for the current frame, or for a range of frames specified with -mnf and -mxf. If you are not already at the start frame, dynExport will run up the scene for you. VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:If you use dynExport in -prompt mode, it does NOT automatically force evaluation of your objects. You must do this yourself from your script. The easiest way is to request each particle object's \"count\" attribute each frame. You must request the count attribute for each object you want to export, because their solvers run independently of one another. In interactive mode, objects WILL get evaluated automatically and you don't have to worry about any of this. When exporting a particle object whose particles are created from collisions involving particles in another particle object(s), you must make sure you simultaneously export all the particle objects involved in the dependency chain otherwise you will get an empty cache file. For non-per-particle attributes, pda and pdb formats write the identical value once for each particle. The following types of non-per-particle attributes can be exported: float, double, doubleLinear, doubleAngle, byte, short, long, enum. The first four are exported as \"Real\" (in PDB parlance), and the last four as \"Integer.\" In the pda and pdb formats, \"particleId\" and \"particleId0\" are exported as Integer, and are exported under the names \"id\" and \"id0\" respectively. All other attributes are exported under their long names. ",

(In this way, you can use an absolute path for export).The -path flag cannot handle strings which include \"/\" or \"\\\", in other words, it lets you go down only one level in the directory hierarchy. If you specify a path which doesn't exist, the action will create it if possible; if it can't create the path it will warn you and fail.

The expression is a block of code of unlimited length with a C-like syntax that can perform conversions, mathematical operations, and logical decision making on any numeric attribute(s) or per-particle attribute(s) in the scene. One expression can read and alter any number of these attributes. Every particle shape in your scene has three expressions, one for the runtimeBeforeDynamics, one for the runtimeAfterDynamics and one for creation time. The create expression gets executed for every particle in the object whose age is 0.0. The runtime expression gets executed for each particle with an age greater then 0.0. Unlike expressions created with the expressioncommand, particle expressions always exist and are a part of the owning particle object's shape. They default to empty strings, but they are always there. Because of this, there is no need to use the '-e' flag. Every call to the dynExpression command is considered an edit by default. Per-particle attributes are those attributes of a particle shape that have a potentially different value for each particle in the object. Examples of these include positionand velocity. If this command is being sent by the command line or in a script, then the user should be sure to embed escaped newlines (\\n), tabs (\\t) for clarity when reading them in the expression editor. Also, quotes in an expression must be escaped (\\\") so that they are not confused by the system as the end of your string. When using the expression editor, these characters are escaped for you unless they are already within quotes. This type of expression is executed during the evaluation of the dynamics. If an output of the expression is requested before that, then the dynamics will be force to compute at that time. If dynamics is disabled, then these expressions will have no effect. ",

It could, for example, be a relative path (ex: \"scenes/myScene.ma\"), it could contain environment variables (ex: \"$PRODUCTION_DIR/myScene.ma\"), and it could even be a path which simply doesn't exist on the local disk. In each of these cases Maya goes through a number of steps resolve the path and find the file on disk. By default the 'file' command will return the resolved file name (e.g. the location from which Maya is actually reading the file), but if the -un/-unresolvedflag is used, the unresolved file (e.g. the one that was originally specified) will be returned. full vs. short name:By default the 'file' command will return the full path to a file, but if the -shn/-shortNameflag is used just the file name will be returned. with vs. without copy number:-wcn/-withoutCopyNumberflag is used the file name without the copy number will be returned.

The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags. By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label text, an float field and a float slider. The text and field controls are optional. Editing or querying the field range values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you to enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags. To do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will result in extending the slider range as well. For example, if you create a slider group with the following command: floatSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to select any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100. If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the slider as well. In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered. Note that the slider limits will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160. ",

Controls have four edges: top, left, bottom and right. There are only two directions that children can be positioned in, right-left and up-down. The attach flags take the direction of an attachment from the argument that names the edge to attach (the second argument). Any or all edges of a child may be attached. There are six ways to attach them: Attach to Form - Attaches an edge to the relevant side of the form layout. Thus -attachForm button3 \"left\" will attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge of the other control named.Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side of another control.Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout. The position is given as a fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a percentage of the form's size.Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will determine this edge's position.Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls visually. There is no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the form they must have at least one edge attached in each direction. Note:In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules: controlmust be the name of an immediate child of the form layout.edgemust be one of \"top\", \"left\", \"bottom\", or \"right\".positionmay range from 0 to the number of divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a measurement. This normally means 0-100 so positionmay be thought of as a percentage.offsetis an integer value in pixels.These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single command.

The transform is the associated dependency node. Use connectDynamic to cause the field to affect a dynamic object. If fields are created, this command returns the names of each of the fields. If a field was queried, the results of the query are returned. If a field was edited, the field name is returned. If object names are provided or the active selection list is non-empty, the command creates a field for every object in the list and calls addDynamic to add it to the object. If the list is empty, the command defaults to -pos 0 0 0. Setting the -pos flag with objects named on the command line is an error. The default for -dx -dy -dz is always the opposite of the current up direction. For example, if the current up direction is (0,1,0) (a standard Maya configuration), then the gravity default is -dx 0 -dy -1 -dz 0. The default for -a is 9.8. 9.8 meters per second squared happens to be standard Earth gravity, but in fact Maya interprets this value as centimeters per second squared. If we were to use it as meters per second squared then with default Maya units, your particles would vanish almost in the wink of an eye. If you want a different value, set it in the gravity option box. ",

Block LayoutThe above diagram shows the layout of each block. The widths: padding, labelWidth and dataWidth are defined by their respective flags. To elaborate on the layout of the blocks, First the padding of the block is calculated. Then the two main sub-blocks (LW and DWX) in the above diagram, are justified and positioned together between the left and right margins of the block. The widths of the main sub-blocks are not variable based on it's contents. The only sub-block in the above diagram which is unique is the DWX sub-block which actually represents X number of sub-blocks, where X is the number of data elements returned by the command. Block PositioningBlocks on the top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport. Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD."

For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4.

For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4.

The hypergraph provides the user with the ability to view and edit the maya scene graph. The hypergraph supports two types of graphs: the DAG or scene hierarchy and the dependency graph. The default view of the hypergraph editor is the DAG view. The user can show the dependency graph for a collection of nodes by first selecting the nodes and navigating to the dependency graph using one of the graph options. The user can save any view by setting a bookmark to that view. The user can also show previous views using the view options provided. The hypergraph supports a simple editing mechanism for editing hierarchy in the DAG view and connections in dependency graph view. In the DAG view, the user can reparent or reorder nodes in the graph using drag-and-drop. In the dependency graph view, the user can select connections and delete them or make new connections by dragging and dropping nodes or existing connections. The hypergraph supports two layout modes in the DAG view: automatic and freeform. In automatic mode, the graph nodes are automatically positioned according to the layout preferences. In freeform mode, the user can position nodes manually. The node position is saved in the scene. A background image can be placed behind DG or DAG in freeform mode. This can be used as a template for positioning nodes in a user-defined layout. Nodes in the DAG view can be expanded or collapsed. The state is saved in the scene. The performance of the graph drawing will increase as hierarchies are collapsed. In addition to hierachy relationships, the hypergraph can show expression, constraint and deformation relationships in the DAG. These can be enabled/disabled through the options provided. There are also additional filters for showing shape nodes and invisible nodes. The amount of detail show may affect the speed of the display of the graph. Most of the UI features of the hypergraph are addressable through the hypergraph command-line interface. The available command-line options are described in the next section. ",

By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.

The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags. By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label text, an integer field and an integer slider. The text and field controls are optional. Editing or querying the field range values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you to enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags. To do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will result in extending the slider range as well. For example, if you create a slider group with the following command: intSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to select any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100. If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the slider as well. In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered. Note that the slider limits will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160.

When editing a Marking Menu, the radial menu items correspond to 8 icons arranged in a circle within the menuEditor. Overflow items in the Marking Menu (or linear items in a normal menu) are displayed in a column below the radial items. To edit a submenu of a popup menu, a new menuEditor instance must be created (typically within its own window) and attached to its parent menuEditor. Some flags require the position of a menu item to be passed in as an argument. For these, positions are specified with a (string,int) pair, where the string corresponds to a radial position (possibily \"None\") and the int corresponds to a linear position (possibly equal to 0 for none). Radial positions are specified by one of (\"N\",0), (\"NE\",0), (\"E\",0), (\"SE\",0), (\"S\",0), (\"SW\",0), (\"W\",0) or (\"NW\",0). Overflow, or linear positions, are specified with (\"None\",i), where i is a 1-based index giving the position of the item within the overflow column.Note:This command in not meant to be called explicitly.

Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys \"dragControl\", \"x\", \"y\", \"modifiers\". The \"dragControl\" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be \"print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'\")"

        "description": "The move command is used to change the positions of geometric objects. The default behaviour, when no objects or flags are passed, is to do a absolute move on each currently selected object in the world space. The value of the coordinates are interpreted as being defined in the current linear unit unless the unit is explicitly mentioned. When using -objectSpace there are two ways to use this command. If numbers are typed without units then the internal values of the object are set to these values. If, on the other hand a unit is specified then the internal value is set to the equivalent internal value that represents that world-space distance. The -localSpace flag moves the object in its parent space. In this space the x,y,z values correspond directly to the tx, ty, tz channels on the object. The -rotatePivotRelative/-scalePivotRelative flags can be used with the -absolute flag to translate an object so that its pivot point ends up at the given absolute position. These flags will be ignored if components are specified. The -worldSpaceDistance flag is a modifier flag that may be used in conjunction with the -objectSpace/-localSpace flags. When this flag is specified the command treats the x,y,z values as world space units so the object will move the specified world space distance but it will move along the axis specified by the -objectSpace/-localSpace flag. The default behaviour, without this flag, is to treat the x,y,z values as units in object space or local space. In other words, the worldspace distance moved will depend on the transformations applied to the object unless this flag is specified. ",

        "description": "This command allows a namespace to be created or set or removed. A namespace is a simple grouping of objects under a given name. Namespaces are primarily used to resolve name-clash issues in Maya, where a new object has the same name as an existing object (from importing a file, for example). Using namespaces, you can have two objects with the same name, as long as they are contained in differenct namespaces. Namespaces are reminiscent of hierarchical structures like file systems where namespaces are analogous to directories and objects are analogous to files. The colon (':') character is the separator used to separate the names of namespaces and nodes instead of the slash ('/') or backslash ('\\') character. Namespaces can contain other namespaces as well as objects. Like objects, the names of namespaces must be unique within another namespace. Objects and namespaces can be in only one namespace. Namespace names and object names don't clash so a namespace and an object contained in another namespace can have the same name. There is an unnamed root namespace specified with a leading colon (':'). Any object not in a named namespace is in the root namespace. Normally, the leading colon is omitted from the name of an object as it's presence is implied. The presence of a leading colon is important when moving objects between namespaces using the 'rename' command. For the 'rename' command, the new name is relative to the current namespace unless the new name is fully qualified with a leading colon. Namespaces are created using the add/addNamespace flag. They are created under the current namespace. Changing the current namespace is done with -set/setNamespace flag. To reset the current namespace to the root namespace, use 'namespace -set \":\";'. Whenever an object is created, it is added to the current namespace. The relativeNamespace flag can be used to change the way node names are displayed in the UI and returned by the 'ls' command. Here are some specific details on how the return from the 'ls' command works in relativeNamespace mode: List all mesh objects in the scene:ls -type \"mesh\";The above command lists all mesh objects in the root and any child namespaces. In relative name lookup mode, all names will be displayed relative to the current namespace. When not in relative name lookup mode (the default behaviour in Maya), results are printed relative to the root namespace.Using a \"\\*\" wildcard:namespace -set myNS;ls -type \"mesh \"\\*\";In relative name lookup mode, the \"\\*\" will match to the current namespace and thus the ls command will list only those meshes defined within the current namespace (i.e. myNs). If relative name lookup is off (the default behaviour in Maya), names are root-relative and thus \"\\*\" matches the root namespace, with the net result being that only thoses meshes defined in the root namespace will be listed.You can force the root namespace to be listed when in relative name lookup mode by specifying \":\\*\" as your search pattern (i.e. ls -type mesh \":\\*\" which lists those meshes defined in the root namespace only). Note that you can also use \":\\*\" when relative name lookup mode is off to match the root if you want a consistent way to list the root.Listing child namespace contents:ls -type mesh \"\\*:\\*\";For an example to list all meshes in immediate child namespaces, use \"\\*:\\*\". In relative name lookup mode \"\\*:\\*\" lists those meshes in immediate child namespaces of the current namespaces. When not in relative name lookup mode, \"\\*:\\*\" lists meshes in namespaces one level below the root.Recursive listing of namespace contents:Example: ls -type mesh -recurse on \"\\*\"The -recurse flag is provided on the \"ls\" command to recursively travese any child namespaces. In relative name lookup mode, the above example command will list all meshes in the current and any child namespaces of current. When not in relative name lookup mode, the above example command works from the root downwards and is thus equivalent to \"ls -type mesh\".",

Using namespaces, you can have two objects with the same name, as long as they are contained in differenct namespaces.

Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys \"dragControl\", \"x\", \"y\", \"modifiers\".

For pfxHair nodes there will always be output, but the format is different than for stroke nodes(however one can assign a brush with tubes = ON to a pfxHair node, in which case it will output the same format as strokes). The general file format is ASCII, using commas to separate numerical values and newlines between blocks of data. The format used for pfxHair nodes presents the hair curves points in order from root to tip of the hair. The hairs follow sequentially in the following fashion: NumCvs pointX,pointY,pointZ, normalX,normalY,normalZ, width, colorR,colorG,colorB, paramU pointX,pointY,pointZ, normalX,normalY,normalZ, width, colorR,colorG,colorB, paramU etc... NumCvs pointX,pointY,pointZ, normalX,normalY,normalZ, width, colorR,colorG,colorB, paramU etc.. The format used to output files for brushes with tubes=ON is more complex. The tubes can branch and the order the segments are written is the same order they are drawn in. Slowly drawing a tall grass brush in the paint effects panel can help to illustrate the order the segments will appear in the file. New tubes can start \"growing\" before others are finished. There is no line for \"NumCvs\". Instead all data for each segment appears on each line. The data on each line is the same as passed into the paint effects runtime function. See the argument list of paintRuntimeFunc.mel for the order and a description of these parameters. The parameters match up exactly in the order they appear on a line of the output file with the order of arguments to this function. If one wishes to parse the output file and connect the segments together into curves the branchId, parentId and siblingCnt parameters can help when sorting which segment connects to which line.

        "description": "This command performs a render sampling of surface color and transparency for each selected vertex or face and stores the sampled data as either the color value, or uses the sampled data to displace the affected vertices or faces by a sampled data value. Transparency is not used for displacement, and displacement is performed along vertex normals. The sampled data value used can be pre-scaled by a user defined amount. Additionally, the normals chosen for sampling can be overridden using a \"flat\" shading option. This option basically means to always use the normals of the faces when computing sampling values. This may be a desired if the user wishes to override an edge smoothness factor. Basically with the \"flat\" shading option on, edges are always considered to be hard. Note that displacement sampling will result in the -sampleByFace option to be turned off, since a displacement of a vertex always affects the faces the vertex is connected to. Finally, it is possible to force the storage of shared colors per vertex, and / or force the usage of unshared UV values. The computation of the resulting color is as follows: resulting-RGB = (sampled-RGB \\* scale-factor);         if (color blend is none)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB         else if (color blend is add)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB + sampled-RGB;         else if (color blend is subtract)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB - sampled-RGB;         else if (color blend is multiply)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB \\* sampled-RGB;         else if (color blend is divide)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB / sampled-RGB;         else if (color blend is average)                 resulting-RGB = (geometry-RGB \\* 1/2) + (sampled-RGB \\* 1/2);         if (clamp option set)                 clamp resulting-RGB between minimum-RGB and maximum-RGB, The analogous computation is done for computing the resulting alpha value.

Typically a face will share vertices and edges with adjacent faces in the same mesh. Sharing vertices and edges helps reduce the amount of memory used by a mesh. It also ensures that when a face is moved, all the connected faces move together.Sometimes you may want to separate a face from its connected faces so that it may be moved in isolation. There are three ways to accomplish this depending upon which parts of the face you want to extract:polySplitVertexsplit one or more vertices so that each face that shared the vertex acquires its own copy of the vertexpolySplitEdgesplit one or more edges so that each face that shared the vertex acquires its own copy of the edgepolyChipOffcompletely extract the face so that it has its own vertices and edgesNotice that the area of affect of each operation is different. polySplitVertex will affect all the edges and faces that shared the vertex. This is the broadest effect. polySplitEdge will only affect the faces which shared the edge and polyChipOff will affect a specific face. If we just count vertices to measure the effect of each command when splitting all components of a face, starting from a 3x3 plane which has 16 vertices and we were to split the middle face:polySplitVertex applied to the four vertices would end up creating 12 new verticespolySplitEdge applied to the four edges would end up creating 4 new verticespolyChipOff applied to the middle face would end up creating 4 new verticesNote that polySplitVertex may create non-manifold geometry as a part of this operation.

The 'referenceQuery -topReference' command can be used to determine what modifications have been made to a given commandTarget. Additionally only unapplied edits will be affected. Edits are unapplied when the node(s) which they affect are unloaded, or when they could not be successfully applied. By default this command only works on failed edits (this can be adjusted using the \"-failedEdits\" and \"-successfulEdits\" flags). Specifying a reference node as the command target is equivalent to specifying every node in the target reference file as a target. In this situation the results may differ depending on whether the target reference is loaded or unloaded. When it is unloaded edits which affect both a node in the target reference and a node in one of its decendant references may be missed (e.g. they may not be removed). Edits which only affect nodes in the target reference or one of its ancestral references, however, should be removed as expected.

If an edit currently affects the old target, it will be changed to affect the new target. You should use 'referenceQuery' to determine the format of the edit targets. As an example most edits store the long name of the attribute (e.g. \"translateX\"), so when specifying the old target, a long name must also be used.

Some flags don't require a target, see flag descriptions for more information on what effect this has. When a scene contains multiple levels of file references, those edits which affect a nested reference may be stored on several different reference nodes. For example: A.ma has a reference to B.ma which has a reference to C.ma which contains a poly sphere (pSphere1). If you were to open B.ma and translate the sphere, an edit would be stored on CRN which refers to a node named \"C:pSphere1\". If you were then to open A.ma and parent the sphere, an edit would be stored on BRN which refers to a node named \"B:C:pSphere1\". It is important to note that when querying edits which affect a nested reference, the edits will be returned in the same format that they were applied. In the above example, opening A.ma and querying all edits which affect C.ma, would return two edits a parent edit affecting \"B:C:pSphere1\", and a setAttr edit affecting \"C:pSphere1\". Since there is currently no node named C:pSphere1 (only B:C:pSphere1) care will have to be taken when interpreting the returned information. The same care should be taken when referenced DAG nodes have been parented or instanced. Continuing with the previous example, let's say that you were to open A.ma and, instead of simply parenting pSphere1, you were to instance it. While A.ma is open, \"B:C:pSphere1\" may now be an amibiguous name, replaced by \"|B:C:pSphere1\" and \"group1|B:C:pSphere1\". However querying the edits which affect C.ma would still return a setAttr edit affecting \"C:pSphere1\" since it was applied prior to B:C:pSphere1 being instanced. Some tips: 1. Use the '-topReference' flag to query only those edits which were applied from the currently open file. 2. Use the '-onReferenceNode' flag to limit the results to those edits where are stored on a given reference node. You can then use various string manipulation techniques to extrapolate the current name of any affected nodes. ",

When an object is at the end (beginning) of the list of siblings, a relative move of 1 (-1) will put the object at the beginning (end) of the list of siblings. That is, relative moves will wrap if necessary. Only nodes within one container can be moved at a time. Note: The container command's -nodeList flag will return a sorted list of contained nodes.

The results from this command are three surface var groups plus the name of the new roundConstantRadius dependency node, if history was on. The 1st var group contains trimmed copies of the original surfaces. The 2nd var group contains the new NURBS fillet surfaces. The 3rd var group contains the new NURBS corners (if any). A simple example of an edge pair is an edge of a NURBS cube, where two faces of the cube meet. This command generates a NURBS fillet at the edge and trims back the faces. Another example is a NURBS cylinder with a planar trim surface cap. This command will create a NURBS fillet where the cap meets the the cylinder and will trim back the cap and the cylinder. Another example involves all 12 edges of a NURBS cube. NURBS fillets are created where any face meets another face. NURBS corners are created whenever 3 edges meet at a corner. ",

They are run during idle events. This means that script jobs do not exist in the batch application. The scriptJob command does nothing in batch mode. This triggering happens very frequently so for speed considerations no events are forwarded during playback. This means that you cannot use scriptJob -tc tcCallback;to alter animation behaviour. Use an expression instead, or the rendering callbacks \"preRenderMel\" and \"postRenderMel\". When setting up jobs for conditions, it is invalid to setup jobs for the true state, false state, and state change at the same time. The behaviour is undefined. The user can only setup jobs for the true and/or false state, or only for the state change, but not three at the same time. i.e. if you do: // Set up a job that runs for the life of the application. // This job cannot be deleted with the \"kill\" command no matter what. scriptJob -e \"SelectionChanged\" \"print \\\"Annoying Message!\\\\n\\\"\" -permanent;// set up a job for the true state scriptJob -ct \"playingBack\" playBackCallback;// set up a job for the false state scriptJob -cf \"playingBack\" playBackCallback;then you should NOT do scriptJob -cc \"playingBack\" playBackCallback;otherwise it will lead to undefined behaviour.

Currently this is primarily intended for internal use within the Preload Reference Editor. selLoadSettings acts on load setting IDs. When implict load settings are built for a target scene, there will be one load setting for each reference in the target scene. Each load setting has a numerical ID which is its index in a pre-order traversal of the target reference hierarchy (with the root scenefile being assigned an ID of 0). Although the IDs are numerical they must be passed to the command as string array. Example: Given the scene: a        / \\       b   c          / \\         d   e where: a references b and c c references d and e the IDs will be as follows: a = 0 b = 1 c = 2 d = 3 e = 4 selLoadSettings can be used to change the load state of a reference: whether it will be loaded or unloaded (deferred) when the target scene is opened. Note: selLoadSettings can accept multiple command parameters, but the order must be selected carefully such that no reference is set to the loaded state while its parent is in the unlaoded state. Given the scene: a | b [-] | c [-] where: a references b b references c a = 0 b = 1 c = 2 and b and c are currently in the unloaded state. The following command will succeed and change both b and c to the loaded state: selLoadSettings -e -deferReference 0 \"1\" \"2\"; whereas the following command will fail and leave both b and c in the unloaded state: selLoadSettings -e -deferReference 0 \"2\" \"1\"; Bear in mind that the following command will also change both b and c to the loaded state: selLoadSettings -e -deferReference 0 \"1\"; This is because setting a reference to the loaded state automatically sets all child references to the loaded state as well.

If you want to select a set, the \"-ne/noExpand\" flag must be used. With the advent of namespaces, selection by name may be confusing. To clarify, without a qualified namespace, name lookup is limited to objects in the root namespace \":\". There are really two parts of a name: the namespace and the name itself which is unique within the namespace. If you want to select objects in a specific namespace, you need to include the namespace separator \":\". For example, 'select -r \"foo\\*\"' is trying to look for an object with the \"foo\" prefix in the root namespace. It is not trying to look for all objects in the namespace with the \"foo\" prefix. If you want to select all objects in a namespace (foo), use 'select \"foo:\\*\"'. Note: When the application starts up, there are several dependency nodes created by the system which must exist. These objects are not deletable but are selectable. All objects (dag and dependency nodes) in the scene can be obtained using the \"ls\" command without any arguments.

For example, an outliner may attach its selected list to one of these objects, and a graph editor may use the same object as a list source. Then, the graph editor would only display objects that are selected in the outliner. Selection connections are UI objects which contain a list of model objects. Selection connections are useful for specifying which objects are to be displayed within a particular editor. Editor's have three plug socketswhere a selection connection may be attached. They are: mainListConnectionan inputsocket which contains a list of objects that are to be displayed within the editorselectionConnectionan outputsocket which contains a list of objects that are selectedwithin the editorhighlightConnectionan inputsocket which contains a list of objects that are to be highlightedwithin the editorThere are several different types of selection connections that may be created. They include: activeLista selection connection which contains a list of everything in the model which is active (which includes geometry objects and keys)modelLista selection connection which contains a list of all the geometry (i.e. excluding keys) objects that are currently activekeyframeLista selection connection which contains a list of all the keys that are currently activeworldLista selection connection which contains a list of all the objects in the worldobjectLista selection connection which contains one model object (which may be a set)listLista selection connection which contains a list of selection connectionseditorLista selection connection which contains a list of objects that are attached to the mainListConnection of the specified editorsetLista selection connection which contains a list of all the sets in the worldcharacterLista selection connection which contains a list of all the characters in the worldhighlightLista selection connection which contains a list of objects to be highlighted in some fashionBelow is an example selectionConnection network between two editors.

As an example, if the space ball is setup with absolute attachment mappings, pressing in one direction will cause the attached attribute to get a constant value. If a relative mapping is used, and the spaceball is pressed in one direction, the attached attribute will get a constantly increasing (or constantly decreasing) value. Note that the definition of relative is different than the definition used by the setInputDeviceMapping command.

Any attachment made to a mapped device axis will have the scale and offset applied to its values. The value from the device is multiplied by the scale and the offset is added to this product. With an absolute mapping, the attached attribute gets the resulting value. If the mapping is relative, the final value is the offset added to the scaled difference between the current device value and the previous device value. This mapping will be applied to the device data before any mappings defined by the setAttrMapping command. A typical use would be to scale a device's input so that it is within a usable range. For example, the device mapping can be used to calibrate a spaceball to work in a specific section of a scene. As an example, if the space ball is setup with absolute device mappings, constantly pressing in one direction will cause the attached attribute to get a constant value. If a relative mapping is used, and the spaceball is pressed in one direction, the attached attribute will jump a constantly increasing (or constantly decreasing) value and will find a rest value equal to the offset. There are important differences between how the relative flag is handled by this command and the setAttrMapping command. (See the setAttrMapping documentation for specifics on how it calculates relative values). In general, both a relative device mapping (this command) and a relative attachment mapping (setAttrMapping) should not be used together on the same axis. ",

        "description": "This command is used to create a set, query some state of a set, or perform operations to update the membership of a set. A set is a logical grouping of an arbitrary collection of objects, attributes, or components of objects. Sets are dependency nodes. Connections from objects to a set define membership in the set. Sets are used throughout Maya in a multitude of ways. They are used to define an association of material properties to objects, to define an association of lights to objects, to define a bookmark or named collection of objects, to define a character, and to define the components to be deformed by some deformation operation. Sets can be connected to any number of partitions. A partition is a node which enforces mutual exclusivity amoung the sets in the partition. That is, if an object is in a set which is in a partition, that object cannot be a member of any other set that is in the partition. Without any flags, the setscommand will create a set with a default name of \"set#\" (where # is an integer). If no items are specified on the command line, the currently selected items are added to the set. The -em/empty flag can be used to create an empty set and not have the selected items added to the set. Sets can be created to have certain restrictions on membership. There can be \"renderable\" sets which only allow renderable objects (such as nurbs geometry or polymesh faces) to be members of the set. There can also be vertex (or control point), edit point, edge, or face sets which only allow those types of components to be members of a set. Note that for these sets, if an object with a valid type of component is to be added to a set, the components of the object are added to the set instead. Sets can have an associated color which is only of use when creating vertex sets. The color can be one of the eight user defined colors defined in the color preferences. This color can be used, for example to distinguish which vertices are being deformed by a particular deformation. Objects, components, or attributes can be added to a set using one of three flags. The -add/addElement flag will add the objects to a set as long as this won't break any mutual exclusivity constraints. If there are any items which can't be added, the command will fail. The -in/include flag will only add those items which can be added and warn of those which can't. The -fe/forceElement flag will add all the items to the set but will also remove any of those items that are in any other set which is in the same partition as the set. There are several operations on sets that can be performed with the setscommand. Membership can be queried. Tests for whether an item is in a set or whether two sets share the same item can be performed. Also, the union, intersection and difference of sets can be performed which returns a list of members of the sets which are a result of the operation. ",

If you have a surface consisting of a number of Bezier patches or any isoparms with more than a single knot multiplicity, you could get into a situation where a tangent break occurs. So, it only makes sense to do this operation on the knot isoparms, and not anywhere in between, because the surface is already smooth everywhere in between.If you have a cubic or higher degree surface, asking for the maximal smoothness will give you tangent, curvature, etc. up to the degree-1 continuity. Asking for tangent will just give you tangent continuity.It should be mentioned that this is \"C\", not \"G\" continuity we're talking about, so technically, you can still see visual tangent breaks if the surface is degenerate.

In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys \"dragControl\", \"dropControl\", \"messages\", \"x\", \"y\", \"type\". The \"dragControl\" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be \"print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'\")"
